> 4 kB date picker

## what

[date](nanocal/README.md) and [range picker](ranger/README.md) that work *with or without* build tools and *with or without* frameworks

for more detailed examples how to use it with frameworks, see [examples](./examples).

## why

don't be satisfied with `moment.js` + `jquery` combo to have a simple date or range picker

## how
